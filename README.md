# Summer-intern-project
 In this reseach intern I investigated the effect of Zr additions on Al-Fe-based eutectic alloys to reduce precipitate coarsening, gaining hands-
on experience with heat treatment, hardness testing, and metallographic polishing. These alloys can be used in powertrain applications
In this project I analyzed microstructural and mechanical data using MATLAB, Origin and Excel; presented findings through a
technical poster summarizing methodology and results
